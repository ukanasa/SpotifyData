# SpotifyData

Requested my listening history from Spotify. Received data as a JSON file and converted it into a csv file using Excel Power Query. I then imported the data for April 2023 to August 2023 into a PostgresQL database and created some queries to investigate my listening history. I first cleaned the data to remove records from podcasts and added some columns to the imported table that extracted the month and day from the timestamp. I also converted the milliseconds played value for each record into minutes for ease of use in following queries. I asked questions such as "What were the Top 10 most listened to artist and songs in the dataset?" and "What was the rank of a song for each month in the data?". Tracking the rank of a song or artist by total minutes played over months provided great insight into my listening habits and also the impact a new song released/found can have on the popularity of other songs by the same artist. It was interesting to find out a track was only listened to the end a total of 1,656 times out of 16,443!
